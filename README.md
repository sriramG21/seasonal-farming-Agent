# 🌾 Seasonal Farm Planner & Risk Alert Agent (Demo)

This is a working prototype developed for **AI Ignite 2025** to demonstrate
an automated, agent-based farming advisory system.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To help farmers make better decisions by automatically analyzing
current weather and seasonal conditions and generating risk alerts
and recommendations.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Detects the current farming season using system date
2. Fetches live weather data from OpenWeather API
3. Evaluates risks using rule-based agent logic
4. Displays alerts and recommendations through a Streamlit UI

---

## 🧪 Demo Features
- Fully automated (no manual weather/season input)
- Real-time weather-based alerts
- Explainable decision logic
- Simple and clean Streamlit interface

## Future scope
In demo which we include only very minimum areas to demonstrate how it works
which in the main project we add:
- Crop-specific advisory rules based on soil type and region
- Gen-AI (LLM) based explanation module to provide natural language farming guidance
- SMS and mobile app notifications for real-time alerts
- Market price and demand-based crop planning support
- Multi-language support to assist farmers across different regions
